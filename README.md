##React App structure

1: node_modules - This folder contains all the files needed to run NPM packages. We never manually change the contents of this folder.

2: public - This folder contains assets with our App. For example favicon.ico, images, manifest.json, fonts.

3: index.html - The main file in our App. All manipulate we do in our react App change this file.

4: package.json - This file contains information about all the packages we installed for development.

5: src - This is our main folder. All changes, we add folders with components, write App logic. All this we do in this folder.
